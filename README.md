# Unit Conversion Program in Python

This Python script allows users to convert between different units of **mass**, **temperature**, and **volume**. It provides a simple text-based interface to input values and get the converted result.

## Features:
1. **Mass Conversions**:
   - Convert from kilograms (kg) to grams (g).
   - Convert from grams (g) to kilograms (kg).

2. **Temperature Conversions**:
   - Convert from Kelvin (K) to Celsius (°C).
   - Convert from Celsius (°C) to Kelvin (K).

3. **Volume Conversions**:
   - Convert from liters (L) to cubic meters (m³).
   - Convert from cubic meters (m³) to liters (L).

## How It Works:
1. The program starts with an introductory prompt asking the user's name.
2. The main function provides options to choose which category of conversion the user wants to perform: **mass**, **temperature**, or **volume**.
3. Based on the user's choice, the program asks for the relevant input and performs the appropriate conversion.
4. The results are displayed with a precision of two decimal points.

### Usage Example:

```bash
What's your name? John
Hello, John
What you want to convert today?
1) Mass 2) Temperature 3) Volume
